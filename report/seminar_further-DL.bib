	abstract = {In a recent research paper, we have proposed an extension of the lightweight Description Logic ({DL}) εL in which concepts can be defined in an approximate way. To this purpose, the notion of a graded membership function m, which instead of a Boolean membership value 0 or 1 yields a membership degree from the interval [0, 1], was introduced. Threshold concepts can then, for example, require that an individual belongs to a concept C with degree at least 0.8. Reasoning in the threshold {DL} τε;L(m) obtained this way of course depends on the employed graded membership function m. The paper defines a specific such function, called deg, and determines the exact complexity of reasoning in τε;L(deg). In addition, it shows how concept similarity measures ({CSMs}) ∼ satisfying certain properties can be used to define graded membership functions m∼, but it does not investigate the complexity of reasoning in the induced threshold {DLs} τε;L(m∼). In the present paper, we start filling this gap. In particular, we show that computability of ∼ implies decidability of τε;L(m∼), and we introduce a class of {CSMs} for which reasoning in the induced threshold {DLs} has the same complexity as in τε;L(deg).},

In addition, there is still a need for similarity measures which are applicable to expressive Description Logics and which are terminological. To address these requirements, we have developed a new family of similarity measures. Two separate empirical studies have been carried out to evaluate the new measures. First, we compare the new measures along with some existing measures against a gold-standard. Second, we examine the practicality of using the new measures over an independently motivated corpus of ontologies.},

	abstract = {Case-based reasoning ({CBR}) based on description logics ({DLs}) has gained a lot of attention lately. Adaptation is a basic task in {CBR} that can be modeled as a knowledge base revision problem which has been solved in propositional logic. However, in {DLs}, adaptation is still a challenge problem since existing revision operators only work well for {DLs} of the {DL}-Lite family. It is difficult to design revision algorithms that are syntax-independent and fine-grained. In this paper, we propose a new method for adaptation based on the tractable {DL} {EL}⊥{EL}⊥{\textbackslash}mathcal\{{EL}\_\{{\textbackslash}bot\}\}. Following the idea of adaptation as revision, we firstly extend the logical basis for describing cases from propositional logic to {DL} and present a formalism for adaptation based on {EL}⊥{EL}⊥{\textbackslash}mathcal\{{EL}\_\{{\textbackslash}bot\}\}. Then we show that existing revision operators and algorithms in {DLs} can not be used for this formalism. Finally we present our adaptation algorithm. Our algorithm is syntax-independent and fine-grained, and satisfies the requirements on revision operators.},

For the {DL} {ELORELOR}{\textbackslash}mathcal\{{ELOR}\}, which covers most of the {OWL} 2 {EL} profile, the lcs and msc need not exist in general, but they always exist if restricted to a given role-depth.

	abstract = {Description logics ({DLs}) have a long tradition in computer science and knowledge representation, being designed so that domain knowledge can be described and so that computers can reason about this knowledge. {DLs} have recently gained increased importance since they form the logical basis of widely used ontology languages, in particular the web ontology language {OWL}. Written by four renowned experts, this is the first textbook on description logics. It is suitable for self-study by graduates and as the basis for a university course. Starting from a basic {DL}, the book introduces the reader to their syntax, semantics, reasoning problems and model theory and discusses the computational complexity of these reasoning problems and algorithms to solve them. It then explores a variety of reasoning techniques, knowledge-based applications and tools and it describes the relationship between {DLs} and {OWL}},
