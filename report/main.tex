  \begin{abstract}
    Measuring similarity of concepts in different description logics is a recurrent task; for this purpose, it is desired to work with tools that guarantee useful properties, related to the semantical equivalence of the concepts.
    However, most of the existing and documented measures, despite claiming these features, lack equivalence invariance and equivalence closure.
    Moreover, many of the measures devised in the past had often been defined with respect to particular clusters of instance data, or they only considered the syntactical level of concept descriptions.

    In this report, the \simi framework for the instantiation of concept similarity measures over the \elh description logic is introduced and discussed.
    This framework, instanciated with respect to several parameters, provides concept similarity measures that respect many desired properties, including concept equivalence and invariance.
    Furthermore, these measures are proved to be efficiently computable, if the parameters are correctly instanciated.
    A brief perspective into related work is finally given, to show other approaches to problems related to concept similarity measures in description logic.
