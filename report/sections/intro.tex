\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Measuring the similarity of two or more concept descriptions is a task that frequently occurs in several real-world cases.
These applications, where ontologies are employed, range from exploration of knowledge bases for information discovery --- as done in~\cite{GF13} --- to more technical activies, like ontology alignment, as in~\cite{CHu11}.


As important as a \emph{good} measure for concept similarity is, one has to deal with several issues during the specification, implementation and usage phases of a tool of this kind.
Most of these have been faced in the work done by Lehmann \& Turhan in~\cite{LeTu12}.

Which are the intended properties for a concept similarity measure?
The notion of similarity itself has been largely discussed in the literature (a remarkable reference is the work done in~\cite{Tve77}).
Among the many, possibly different, existing approaches to similarity, the one shows in [] has been followed in this work.
In particular, relevant properties of similarity have been described and formalised; some of these have been drawn from what has been already established in the literature, whereas others have been newly introduced.
These properties are either concerning the mathematical side of a measure or its relation with the underlying representation of the concepts.

Description Logics (\dl) are a family of formal knowledge representation languages.
The \dl \elh, upon which \(\simi\) has been defined, has a practical relevance: for example, the medical ontology \textsc{snomed ct}~\cite{snomed} employs a variant of \elh, and the Web standard \textsc{Owl-el}, described in~\cite{owlEL}, is originated from \elh.
In this setting, it is shown how a concept similarity measure can be defined, which achieves \emph{power} --- thanks to \emph{equivalence invariance} and \emph{closure} ---, \emph{flexibility} in the choice of its parameters and \emph{efficiency} in its computation, assuming that the right tools are used in its construction.

This work also addresses another issue: the \emph{portability} and \emph{reliability} of concept similarity measures, across different contexts.
Indeed, many existing measures are domain-related or depend too much on the dataset upon which they are first defined, assessed and evaluated.
The choice, here, is that of defining a framework, a general concept similarity measure which can be specifically instantiated, by means of several parameters; this allows the user to tailor the measure to her particular application, without losing the desired properties, guaranteed to hold by the way the introduce measure \(\simi\) has been specified.

The report has the following structure:
first, some notions concerning \dl{}s are introduced;
then, similarity measure are discussed, with their properties;
next, the framework devised in~\cite{LeTu12} is derived and explained;
finally, some results are shown, reguarding the properties of the new measure.
In the end, an overview of related works is presented, followed by a brief conclusion.
